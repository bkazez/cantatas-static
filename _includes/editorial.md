Note: **{{ include.column }}** must use brackets to distinguish what is editorial vs original.
- If part or all of the value was added by an editor (typically shown in italics in the edition), use `[]`. For example, `14[a]` means that the `a` was added by the editor. (Sometimes the edition specifies editorial additions in parentheses â€“ replace these with square brackets.)
- If part or all of the value was added by the contributor (you!), use `<>`. For example, `<5>` means you added the movement number 5.
