If part or all of the value was added by an editor (typically shown in italics in the edition), use `[]`. For example, `a[bc]` means that the “bc” was added by the editor. Sometimes the edition specifies editorial additions in parentheses – replace these with square brackets. Note that editorial time signatures may be denoted just with smaller type.

If part or all of the value was added by the contributor (you!), use `<>`. For example, `a<bc>` means you added the “bc”.
