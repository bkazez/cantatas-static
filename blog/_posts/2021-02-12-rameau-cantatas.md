I first studied French baroque music with Peter Harvey and Claire Guimond at Tafelmusik Baroque Summer Institute. I fell in love with it, and I’ve been excited to make this repertoire easier to find via VMII.

But there was a wrinkle. As you may know, French composers often call for flexible instrumentation like “dessus” (high voice or instrument) or “basse instrumentale” (non-continuo bass instrument). Even with just two dessus lines, that can mean dozens of possible instrument combinations, which gets complicated to search efficiently.

I spent weeks racking my brain and bothering my friends (Andrew Wong, Vijay Chalasani, Brian Mason, etc.) to try to find the simplest solution, and I think we finally cracked it. So, here’s the first French baroque music on VMII: the beautiful cantatas of Jean-Philippe Rameau.
