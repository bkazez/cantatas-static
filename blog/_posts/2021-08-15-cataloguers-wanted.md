Anne has decided to stop working on www.vmii.org as she starts her French pastry course. Please join me in thanking her for the nearly 9,000 movements (many coming soon) that she's catalogued!

Can you think of anyone who might like to catalogue a few movements for the project? Some nerdy HP sort who likes collecting things? Or someone who wants a particular composerâ€™s music to get performed more often? We have Buxtehude, Handel, and so much more, ready for cataloguing!
