Today we finished cataloguing 284 movements from Jacquet de La Guerre’s cantatas and opera. When we posted about this on Facebook, it “helpfully” translated Jacquet de La Guerre to “Jackets of War.” Though her music doesn’t have much in the way of jackets or war, it’s gorgeous and deserves to be performed more often. Hopefully now that it’s catalogued alongside more common composers like JS Bach, this will finally happen!
