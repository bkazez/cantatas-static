As a singer, I often wish I had a way to browse Bach cantata arias by instrument combinations or textual themes. Fortunately, I recently found myself stuck in a pandemic with nothing but a computer and a French baroque flautist for company.

In a few weeks, the flautist (Anne Charrier) had typed up the instrumentation for all 1,699 movements of the Bach cantatas, and I had made a site to search them.

Unfortunately, Anne insisted on also typing up some of her favorite things, like the complete vocal works of CPE Bach, complete cantatas of Handel, Clérambault and Campra, and rare airs de cour of Lambert.

Also unfortunately, I insisted on doing dozens of design iterations and implementing multi-lingual full-text search so you can search by texts in English, French, German, and Italian.

Since in the meantime my French visa expired and therefore I had difficulty concentrating, Anne had some extra time, which she used to type up the range for <span class="sc">every line</span> of <span class="sc">every</span> Bach cantata aria, which only left me with more stuff to program.

Fortunately, this vicious cycle of absurd perfectionism has come to a triumphant end, and we hereby bring you: the <span class="sc">Vocal Music Instrumentation Index</span>! It’s just the 2,094 movements of JS Bach vocal music for now, but more is coming soon. Hope it can help people find rep for their students or themselves. Enjoy and tell us what you think!
