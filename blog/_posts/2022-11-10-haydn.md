Well, I think we've been Haydn this for long enough: you can now search every last movement of Haydn's vocal works by instrumentation, title, and key, for a total of 1,769 movements. Youâ€™ll find lots of gems in here, like Scottish folk song arrangements, silly canons, operas I'd never heard of, and much more.

This project posed unique challenges, largely thanks to Haydn's inconsistent (transitional?) continuo instrumentation. The main cataloguer was Thomas Weis, who is relatively new to VMII, so huge thanks to him for all his work.
