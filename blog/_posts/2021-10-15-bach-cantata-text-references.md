One of <span class="acronym">VMII</span>’s newest cataloguers, [Elizabeth Pineo](/cataloguers/elizabeth-pineo), has just finished adding textual references for all the Bach cantatas, including scripture readings, verbatim/paraphrase quotations, and more. She started in December and has quietly and carefully soldiered on until finishing just now! Elizabeth says:

“I was initially drawn to working on J.S. Bach’s cantatas by my love for coffee. That is, by my love for Bach’s [Coffee Cantata](https://www.vmii.org/bwv-211-schweigt-stille-plaudert-nicht). While the Coffee Cantata doesn’t have any textual references to speak of, most of Bach’s cantatas do! The [last movement of BWV 185](https://www.vmii.org/bwv-185-barmherziges-herze-der-ewigen-liebe/6-ich-ruf-zu-dir-herr-jesus-christ-2nd) is a great example of this. I can’t wait for people to explore all of those references on VMII!”

This will of course be super useful for anyone performing or learning about these cantatas. Please join me in thanking Elizabeth for her great contribution!
