Since 4915 movements didn’t seem like enough, we’re announcing new VMII data today — thanks to new contributor extraordinaire, Emma Clarkson.

Like most people, she’s a Yale graduate, arts administrator, stage manager, and amateur baroque violinist who happens to love classical music metadata and is getting a Master’s in Library and Information Science from UW. Since my most recent training mainly involves my soft palate, it’s been great to work with her on thorny cataloguing issues.

So far, Emma has painstakingly catalogued 230 movements of Handel cantatas from the Hallische Handel-Ausgabe — with texts and instrumentation — so we can all find beautiful music to play. And you can search it all today! www.vmii.org
