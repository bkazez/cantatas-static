This field accepts special bracketing to distinguish what is editorial vs original.

## Editorial additions
Text added by an editor, typically shown in italics in an edition.
For example, `14[a]` means that the `a` was added by the editor.

Sometimes the edition specifies editorial additions in parentheses.
In this case, replace the parentheses with square brackets:

```
[Baritono]
```

## Contributor additions
Text that you added, such as movement numbers: `<5>` means you added the movement number 5.
