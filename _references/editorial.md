This field accepts special bracketing (`[]&lt;&gt;`) to distinguish:

original text
: Text that came from the actual composer. Type this as usual.

editorial additions
: Text added by an editor, typically shown in italics in an edition: `14[a]` means that the `a` was added by the editor.

contributor additions
: Text that you added, such as movement numbers: `&lt;5&gt;` means you added the movement number 5.
