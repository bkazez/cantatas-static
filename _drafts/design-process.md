title: How our design came to be
---

After we launched VMII, Ray Heigemeir at the Stanford Music Library made my day with this praise: “nice clean visuals, easy to navigate.” A few people assumed the search interface was something default or pre-existing, which in a way was the best compliment—good design feels inevitable, as ex-Apple designer Jonathan Ive says.

Of course, as with music, “inevitable” visual clarity and ease takes lots of work. Anne and I knew we wanted to solve a problem we had—finding baroque music by instrumentation—but the resulting form was far from inevitable.

Before sketching out ideas, I wanted to understand the historical context. I started by exploring tables of contents in old musical editions, which seem like the most common representation of lists of movements of music. A friend pointed me to ecological categorizations like textual representations of taxonomy trees. This work reminded me of old dictionaries I’d seen in Carleton College’s Rare Books Library years earlier, like Johnson’s beautiful dictionaries (from which I shamelessly stole the red and black color scheme).

We have beautiful printed references from our time, too, like Alfred Dürr’s _Cantatas of J. S. Bach_ and the front matter of beautiful editions like Neue Bach-Ausgabe. I wanted VMII to have the feel of cracking open a beautiful new score, combined with the classic feel of scannable references from the period. But since we were making a web site, I wanted it to feel modern, fast, and accessible. Why shouldn’t it be as easy to find vocal repertoire as it is to find, say, a pair of shoes at Nike.com?

Fortunately, Anne hates poorly organized information even more than I do. I returned to the blank slate of pencil and paper sketches, and then quickly moved into mockups in the Sketch app. I showed these designs to Anne and others without much explanation, to get quick feedback. Even though it was early stages, I appreciated the high-fidelity feel of Sketch prototypes, since execution has an outsize effect on the success of a design.

In the past, I’ve “perfectionised” (that works better in French) designs until I just had to figure out the code to make them interactive. This time, I tried to get to the interactive phase as fast as possible. I was inspired by hearing about the design of the Macintosh menubar, which apparently involved nightly marathons of programming so that every day people could try a real interaction, rather than discussing something that didn’t exist. I also felt that my musical
