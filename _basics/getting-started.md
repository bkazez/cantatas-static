To contribute to <span class="acronym">VMII</span>, you simply make a spreadsheet in Google Sheets, and it’ll be imported automatically. <a href="mailto:contact@vmii.org">Contact us</a> for a template.

In the spreadsheet, make a new row for each movement, including instrumental ones. Some operas have dialogue – you’ll make a “movement” for dialogue, too. Include sketches only if someone could actually perform them.

In your spreadsheet, you can add any formatting (e.g., color coding) you want, since all formatting gets discarded before the data is imported. Note that this means that you have to use special symbols to denote <code>_italics_</code> and other formatting – more about that later.

You’ll need to work from a good scholarly (collected works) edition, or else an edition or manuscript from the original time period. Contact us if you’re not sure which score to use.

Most cataloguers find it easiest to start by typing the work/movement numbers/titles. If your edition has a table of contents, you should be able to start there.

See the [reference guide](/docs/reference) to learn about all the columns.
