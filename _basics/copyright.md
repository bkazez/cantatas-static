As a general guideline, you must only type factual information, not creative work. If someone else’s creative work is very old or otherwise in the public domain, you can copy it without written permission. Otherwise, you must get written permission from the copyright holder.

If you need to quote a brief part of someone’s creative work, use quotation marks and cite your source.

As an example, text translations are creative work, so you can’t type them unless you get written permission. However, if a few words from a reference book would be helpful to <span class="acronym">VMII</span> users, you can type that as long as you put it in quotation marks and cite your source.

Detailed guidance can be found online, for example <a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/" target="_blank">from Stanford</a>.
