As a rule, type exactly what’s in the score.

## Modern scores
If your score is modern and recent, match the spelling and capitalization of the score. If your score is modern but slightly older (e.g., from the 1930s with slightly older spellings), update spellings and capitalization based on a modern rules. (For German, see <a href="https://grammis.ids-mannheim.de/rechtschreibung/6180">Deutsche Rechtschreibung</a> regarding the German letter ß.)

## Historical scores
If your score is from the original time period, use the original spellings for titles, texts, etc.

For texts, it can be helpful to see the original spelling and capitalization alongside modernized spelling and capitalization. For example, for a historical French libretto with old spelling, type this in **text_fr_orig**. Add the modernized version in **text_fr**. See [historical texts](/docs/references/text_orig) for details.
