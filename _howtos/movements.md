title: How to break works into movements
---

Usually, an edition or manuscript clearly divides works into movements with headings like “Aria” or “Recit.” For works that aren’t clearly divided into movements, choose “movement” boundaries that show the structure of the work and help users find performable excerpts.

Start a new movement if several of these are true:

<ol class="list">
  <li>The preceding measure has a fermata or final-sounding cadence.</li>
  <li>The previous line of text is the end of a poem or substantial verse.</li>
  <li>The text starts with a capital letter.</li>
  <li>The meter, instrumentation, key, and/or tempo change.</li>
  <li>There is a double bar line, especially with no meter change.</li>
</ol>

Don’t start a new movement if:

<ol class="list">
  <li>the text/sentence continues or repeats.</li>
  <li>the “movement” is just a short adagio echo at the end of a fast movement.</li>
</ol>

Unfortunately this is just a guide. If many of the items in the first list are true, that could trump the “don’t start a movement if…” list. When in doubt, ask!
