Sometimes, the librettist or composer created a text from multiple sources – for example, taking some text verbatim from John 16:2–3 and adapting other text from a hymn.

Knowing the origin of the text is hugely helpful to performers and people interested in this music.

You can describe these kinds of adaptations using **text_references** and **text_reference_types**, which work together.

For example, here’s how to catalogue a movement with verbatim text from John 16:2–3 as well as adapted text from a 1587 hymn:

<div class="side-scroll">
  <table class="table table-simple">
    <tr>
      <th>**text_references**</th>
      <th>**text_reference_types**</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td class="text-nowrap">
        ```
          John 16:2-16:3
          first verse of _Jesu dulcis memoria_ by Martin Moller (1587)
        ```
      </td>
      <td class="text-nowrap">
        ```
          verbatim
          adapted
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
