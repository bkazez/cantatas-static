title: How to add text references
column: text_references
---
Sometimes, the librettist or composer created a text from multiple sources – for example, taking some text verbatim from John 16:2–3 and adapting other text from a hymn. Knowing this origin of the text is hugely helpful. To describe these kinds of adaptations, use the columns **text_references** and **text_reference_types** together.

For example, here’s how to catalogue a movement with verbatim text from John 16:2–3 as well as adapted text from a 1587 hymn:

**text_references:**
```
John 16:2-16:3
first verse of _Jesu dulcis memoria_ by Martin Moller (1587)
```

**text_reference_types:**
```
verbatim
adapted
```
