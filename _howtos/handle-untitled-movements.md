title: How to handle untitled movements

## For vocal movements
Use the first few words (also known as the incipit) as the title:

1. Ideally, use the first line of poetry as the title. You might have to search for a libretto or look for clues in the score like capitalization.
2. Otherwise, choose a title that is long enough to differentiate the movement from others with similar names. Stop at a punctuation mark or clause boundary to make the meaning clear: for example, `Nichts soll uns scheiden` (“Nothing shall separate us”) not `Nichts soll uns` (“Nothing shall us”).
3. When in doubt, choose a longer title, to give users more information.

## For instrumental movements
Catalogue the movement type as usual and leave the movement title blank.
