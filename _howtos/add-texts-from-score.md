title: How to add texts from a score
---

If you can’t find a modern libretto, you’ll have to type the text directly from the score, adding line breaks as needed to turn it back into poetry.

1. Pick the right column for the language: **text_fr**, **text_de**, etc.
2. Type the text for the given movement. Don't repeat words that the composer chose to repeat – instead of “genug, ich habe genug,” type “Ich habe genug.”
3. If the text is poetry, add line breaks as needed. Some clues:
   - Search the internet for other uses of the same text.
   - Look for capitalized words in the score – these might indicate the beginning of a line.
   - Look for rhyme and meter schemes – try speaking the text aloud.
