These columns work together and describe any sources that the librettist or composer used to create the text.
- Each line of **text_references** describes a source (scriptures, hymns, etc.) that the text is adapted from.
- Each corresponding line of **text_reference_types** explains the nature of that adaptation.

# Possible **text_reference_types**

`adapted`
: The text is altered to make it suitable for performance (e.g., it was originally a poem, but it was reworked to become a dialogue between two characters).

`verbatim`
: The text has not changed at all.

`paraphrased`
: The meaning remains the same, but the text has been changed (to make its meaning clearer, to make it fit the melody better, to fit it grammatically to the preceding libretto, etc.).`

`referenced`
: The style or imagery of a text is substantially invoked, but the text itself is not used.
