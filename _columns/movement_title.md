The movement title in the original language, as given in the score.

For instrumental movements called by their movement type (Sonata, Overture, Sinfonia, etc.), leave `movement_title` blank and type these in `movement_type_orig`.

If a vocal movement has no title, use the first few words (also known as the incipit) as the title:

1. Ideally, use the first line of poetry as the title. You might have to search for a libretto or look for clues in the score like capitalization.
2. Otherwise, choose a title that is long enough to differentiate the movement from others with similar names. Stop at a punctuation mark or clause boundary to make the meaning clear: `Nichts soll uns scheiden`, not `Nichts soll uns`.
3. When in doubt, choose a longer title, to give users more information.
