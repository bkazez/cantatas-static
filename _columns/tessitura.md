The range of lowest and highest "frequently used" notes of each corresponding musical line, with octaves in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation" target="_blank">scientific pitch notation</a>. Use `b` for flat and `#` for sharp.

For example, if a musical line is mostly between C2 and F3 but has just one or two C4s, the tessitura is:
