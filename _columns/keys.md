name: "key_start / key_end"
---
The starting and ending keys – the [actual tonalities](/docs/how-to/catalogue-keys), _not just the key signatures_ – using uppercase for major, lowercase for minor, `#` for sharp, and `b` for flat. For example:

- Db minor → `db`
- C# major → `C#`

If typing keys from a reference source, cite it as <code>source_background</code>. Otherwise, please read [How to Catalogue Keys](/docs/how-to/catalogue-keys) even if you have music background.
