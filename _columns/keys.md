name: "key_start / key_end"
---
The starting and ending keys – the [actual tonalities](/docs/how-to/catalogue-keys), _not just the key signatures_ – using uppercase for major, lowercase for minor, `#` for sharp, and `b` for flat. For example:

- Bb minor → `bb`
- C# major → `C#`

If typing keys from a reference source, cite it as `source_background`. Otherwise, please read [How to Catalogue Keys](/docs/how-to/catalogue-keys) even if you have music background.

Note that the key signature may be missing or not the actual key.

For **key_start**, don’t look farther than the first 8 beats.

**key_end** is the last key that’s established at the end of the performed music, ignoring Picardy thirds or dominant endings:
- If a movement has a da capo, type the ending key of the A section, _not_ of the B section.
- If a movement ends with a Picardy third, type the corresponding _minor_ key.
- If a movement ends with a dominant chord, write the original, not dominant key.
