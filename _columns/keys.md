The starting and ending keys – the [actual tonalities](/docs/how-tos/how-to-catalogue-keys), _not just the key signatures_ – using uppercase for major, lowercase for minor, `#` for sharp, and `b` for flat.

Db minor
: `db`

C# major
: `C#`

If typing keys from a reference source, cite it as <code>source_background</code>. Otherwise, figure out the keys yourself – please read [How to Catalogue Keys](/docs/how-tos/how-to-catalogue-keys) even if you have music background.
