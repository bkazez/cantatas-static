Type every tempo in the movement, in the order that they appear. Ignore repeats.

If no tempo is listed at the beginning, but a tempo does appear later in the piece, type like this:

```
; Allegro
```

<p>Note: For French movements like “Air gai,” type <code>Air gai</code> in <code>movement_type_orig</code>, <code>air</code> in <code>movement_type</code>, and <code>gai</code> in <code>tempo</code>.</p>
