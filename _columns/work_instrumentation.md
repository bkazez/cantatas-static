The instrumentation required to perform the whole work.

List each independent musical line on a separate line of the cell according to the rules below.

1. List the instruments in the same vertical order that this particular edition edition uses. (It's not about standard orchestral order but the vertical order used in the score.)
2. Each line represents an independent musical part played by one or more people. For example, if there are two horn parts that each need horns in 3 keys – but the music never has more than two horn lines at once – type:
```
Corno I in C, F, G
Corno II in C, F, G
```
3. Include modifiers like solo, obbligato, ripieno, etc., only if they apply to every movement where the instrument plays.
4. Type the continuo line as for **[instrumentation](#instrumentation)**.

If the score doesn't explicitly list the instruments required to perform the whole work, read [How to add work instrumentation](/docs/how-to/add-work-instrumentation).
