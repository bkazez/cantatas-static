In the score, look at each movement, and look for and type words that you see that deal with structure, such as `Da capo` and `Dal segno`. Usually these appear at the last measure of a movement, near the last printed measure of music.

Donâ€™t mention simple double bars with repeat signs.

Example:
```
Da [capo]; Attacca
```
